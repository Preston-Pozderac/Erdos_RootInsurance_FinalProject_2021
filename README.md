## Project Overview:

The ACME Insurance Company is assessing its marketing spending on a vertical search channel.
A customer will enter infromation about their insurance needs, and insurance companies will place a bid for the customer.
Ads are then displayed in order of highest to lowest bids for the customer from rank 1 to 5.
When a customer clicks on the ad, the company pays the price of their bid and the customer is then able to purchase a policy. 


## Project Goal:

Determine a bidding strategy, based on the type of customer, that will optimize the cost per policy sold while ensuring that 400 policies are sold per 10,000 ads.


## Approach

We developed three models to predict the key output variables of: Ad Rank, Number of Clicks, and Policies Sold.
